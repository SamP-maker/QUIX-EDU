## ðŸ§© Scratch â€“ Ages 5â€“14

**Scratch courses** are designed to teach young learners the **fundamentals of programming** through creativity and fun. Students will:

- Learn sequencing, loops, conditions, and events
- Create games, animations, and interactive stories
- Understand real-world logic through simulations
- Use a drag-and-drop interface â€“ no typing required!

This is perfect for first-time coders and visual learners.

## ðŸ’» High-Level Programming â€“ Ages 14+

These courses introduce real-world programming languages and concepts using:

- `JavaScript` â€“ Web interactivity and frontend basics  
- `Python` â€“ Clean syntax, automation, and data-friendly  
- `C++` â€“ Logic-heavy, performance-oriented language

### Topics Covered:

- Programming fundamentals (variables, loops, functions)
- Project-based learning (mini apps & challenges)
- Intro to code editors and development tools
- Logical and computational thinking

Ideal for students transitioning from Scratch or new to typed code.

## ðŸ§  Advanced Programming â€“ Ages 15+

This level is for students ready to dive into **real software development**. Students use `JavaScript`, `Python`, `C++`, and optionally `TypeScript`, `Go`, and other modern tools.

### Topics Covered:

- **Web Development Tools**: NPM, GitHub, Webpack
- **IDEs**: Visual Studio Code, Replit, JetBrains
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: React, Express, Flask, Three.js
- **APIs**: How to use and create RESTful APIs
- **Stacks**: Full-stack development (frontend + backend)
- **UI/UX Design**: Application flow and component systems
- **Testing & Debugging**: Clean code, unit tests, problem solving
- **Capstone Projects**: Build deployable apps, games, and tools

This track is **project-based** and prepares students for real-world development, internships, or launching their own applications.
