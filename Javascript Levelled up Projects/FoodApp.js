/*

Create an app that allows users to explore recipes based on ingredients they have at home. 
The app can display a list of recipes, filter by meal type or dietary restrictions, and even provide nutritional information. 
Optionally, it could fetch recipes from an API (e.g., Spoonacular) or use a custom recipe database.
